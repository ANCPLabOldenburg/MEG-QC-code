    Flip the channels if the peak of the artifact is negative and located close to the estimated t0.

    Flip approach: 

    - define  a window around the ecg/eog event deteceted by mne. This is not the real t0, but  an approximation. 
        The size of the window defines by how large on average the error of mne is when mne algorythm estimates even time. 
        So for example if mne is off by 0.05s on average, then the window should be -0.05 to 0.05s. 
    - take 5 channels with the largest peak in this window - assume these peaks are the actual artifact.
    - find the average of these 5 peaks - this is the new estimated_t0 (but still not the real t0)
    - create a new window around this new t0 - in this time window all the artifact wave shapes should be located on all channels.
    - flip the channels, if they have a peak inside of this new window, but the peak is negative and it is the closest peak to estimated t0.

    1. Calculate average ECG epoch on the epochs from all channels. Check if average has a wave shape. 
    If no wave shape - no need to check for affected channels further.
    If it has - check further

    2. Set a threshold which defines a high amplitude of ECG event. (All above this threshold counted as potential ECG peak.)
    Threshold is the magnitude of the peak of the average ECG/EOG epoch multiplued by norm_lvl. 
    norl_lvl is chosen by user in config file
    
    3. Find all peaks above this threshold.
    Finding approach:

    - again, set t0 actual as the time point of the peak of an average artifact (over all channels)
    - again, set a window around t0_actual. this new window is defined by how long the wave of the artifact normally is. 
        The window is centered around t0 and for ECG it will be -0.-02 to 0.02s, for EOG it will be -0.1 to 0.1s.
    - find one main peak of the epoch for each channel which would be inside this window and closest to t0.
    - if this peaks magnitude is over the threshold - this channels is considered to be affected by ECG or EOG. Otherwise - not affected.
        (The epoch has to have a wave shape).

    4. Affected and non affected channels will be plotted and outputted as lists for adding tothe json on the next step.
