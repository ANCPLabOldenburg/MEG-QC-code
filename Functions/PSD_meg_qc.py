    '''Calculates frequency spectrum of the data and if desired - plots them.

    Freq spectrum peaks we see (visible on shorter interval, ALMOST NONE SEEN when Welch is done over all time):
    50, 100, 150 - powerline EU
    6 noise of shielding chambers 
    44 meg noise
    17 - was it the train station near by?
    10 Secret :)
    1hz - highpass filter.
    flat spectrum is white noise process. Has same energy in every frequency (starts around 50Hz or even below)
    
    Args:
    data (mne.raw): data in raw format
    m_or_g (str): which channel type to use
    plotflag (bool): do you need plot or not
    sid (str): subject id number, like '1'
    freq_min (float): minimal frequency of interest for frequency spectrum decomposition
    freq_max (float): maximal frequency of interest for frequency spectrum decomposition
    n_fft (float): The length of FFT used, must be >= n_per_seg (default: 256). The segments will be zero-padded if n_fft > n_per_seg. 
        If n_per_seg is None, n_fft must be <= number of time points in the data. (*)
    n_per_seg (float): Length of each Welch segment (windowed with a Hamming window). Defaults to None, which sets n_per_seg equal to n_fft. (*)
    (*) These influence the bandwidth.
    freq_tmin (float): crop a chun of data for psd calculation: start time (instead could just pass the already cropped data). 
        If None - calculates over whole data
    freq_tmax (float): crop a chun of data for psd calculation: end time (instead could just pass the already cropped data). 
        If None - calculates over whole data
    ch_names (list of tuples): mag or grad channel names + their indexes

    Returns:
    freqs (np.ndarray): numpy array of frequencies 
    psds (np.ndarray): numpy array of power spectrum dencities
