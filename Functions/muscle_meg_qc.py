# # Annotate muscle artifacts
# 
# Muscle contractions produce high frequency activity that can mask brain signal
# of interest. Muscle artifacts can be produced when clenching the jaw,
# swallowing, or twitching a cranial muscle. Muscle artifacts are most
# noticeable in the range of 110-140 Hz.
# 
# This example uses :func:`~mne.preprocessing.annotate_muscle_zscore` to annotate
# segments where muscle activity is likely present. This is done by band-pass
# filtering the data in the 110-140 Hz range. Then, the envelope is taken using
# the hilbert analytical signal to only consider the absolute amplitude and not
# the phase of the high frequency signal. The envelope is z-scored and summed
# across channels and divided by the square root of the number of channels.
# Because muscle artifacts last several hundred milliseconds, a low-pass filter
# is applied on the averaged z-scores at 4 Hz, to remove transient peaks.
# Segments above a set threshold are annotated as ``BAD_muscle``. In addition,
# the ``min_length_good`` parameter determines the cutoff for whether short
# spans of "good data" in between muscle artifacts are included in the
# surrounding "BAD" annotation.
