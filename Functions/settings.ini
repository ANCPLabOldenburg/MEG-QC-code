# BEST data set. 
# ! 1 eog, 1 ecg, ALL GOOD. Ecg only has problem at SID:  
# 022 - probably event detected wrong. after the event, there is a much larger peak, more likely to be R wave. Hence the wrong detection of my algorythm, cos it relies on time 0 of the event.
# 012, 009 - very flat peaks, hard to fige which to flip. 012 - which peak is actually the R wave: -0.03 or -0.01? Again might be problem with tine0 detection
# PSD: no powerline artifacts at all! Or any other psd peaks except at 1hz.
# Head not working: it is computing all the way but no positions in the end.

# EOG 061 bad (or rather unusual), EOG 062 good. Mne takes only the good channel and calculates events on base of it? or does it just take blinks?
